# FAIR Assessment

This section is dedicated to describing the processes and tools available to perform a quantitative assessment of the level of FAIR compliance of a given resource.
It includes:

- A description of the FAIRshake service and how it is being used to evaluate the output of first [ETL](https://docs.nih-cfde.org/en/latest/CFDE-glossary/#extract-transform-load-process-etl) processes developed under NIH-CFDE.
- A guideline and an example of developing FAIR application program interface, as FAIR also applies to services, and not just datasets.
