This section is dedicated to describing the processes and tools available to perform a quantitative assessment of the level of FAIR compliance of a given resource.
It includes:

- A description of the FAIRshake service and how it is being used to evaluate the output of first Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) processes developed under NIH-CFDE.
- A guideline and an example of developing FAIR application program interface, as FAIR also applies to services, and not just datasets.
