# Engaging with CFDE

On January 29, 2020, the NIH Common Fund posted OTA-20-005 Engaging Common Fund Data Coordinating Centers to Establish the Common Fund Data Ecosystem. This announcement invited Engagement Plans from Common Fund Data Coordinating Centers (DCCs) to engage with the Common Fund Data Ecosystem Coordinating Center (CFDE-CC) and with each other to establish the CFDE. Since the original announcement several rounds of Engagement Plan submissions and review were completed. Future Engagement Plans from Common Fund are expected to continue in the future if the CFDE program continues. 

For more information, including a full overview of the engagement process, please refer to the [NIH-CFDE project engagement page](https://nih-cfde.org/engagement/).
