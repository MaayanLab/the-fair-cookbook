# Engaging with CFDE:

On January 29, 2020, the NIH Common Fund posted OTA-20-005 Engaging Common Fund Data Coordinating Centers to Establish the Common Fund Data Ecosystem. This announcement invites Engagement Plans from Common Fund Data Coordinating Centers (DCCs) to engage with the Common Fund Data Ecosystem Coordinating Center (CFDE-CC) and with each other to establish the CFDE. The original announcement provided dates for two rounds of Engagement Plan submissions and review.

Based on lessons learned from the first round of Engagement Plan submission and review, and to maintain maximum flexibility in the face of the coronavirus/COVID-19 pandemic, the NIH Common Fund has switched to rolling submission of Engagement Plans, effective May 2020. This change means that the dates for the second round of Engagement Plan submission are no longer in effect. Engagement Plans will be accepted through May 2021.

For more information, a full overview of the engagement process is available from the [NIH-CFDE project page](https://nih-cfde.org/engagement/).

In addition, a specific chapter details technical aspects and requirements, with the following subsections:
